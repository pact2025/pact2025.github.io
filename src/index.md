# Student Research Competition

<br>

## About

The Student Research Competition (SRC) at PACT 2025 provides a unique opportunity for students to present their research and receive feedback from experienced researchers in the community. This competition allows students to network, improve their presentation skills, and showcase their work to an audience of peers and experts. Both undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to participate.

## Eligibility Criteria

Participants must be current students (graduate or undergraduate) at the time of submission. An active ACM student membership is required. The competition is divided into two categories:

- **Undergraduate:** Currently pursuing a bachelor's degree.
- **Graduate:** Currently pursuing a master's or PhD degree.

## Call for Papers

Submissions should include:

- **Problem and Motivation:** Clearly define the problem and explain the need for a solution.
- **Background and Related Work:** Provide context and relevant references, highlighting how your work differs from existing research.
- **Approach and Uniqueness:** Describe your novel approach to addressing the problem.
- **Results and Contributions:** Present your findings and explain their significance to programming languages and computer science.

Submissions must be original and unpublished work. Submissions must be original research that is not already published at PACT or another conference or journal. One of the goals of the SRC is to give students feedback on ongoing, unpublished work. Furthermore, the abstract must be authored solely by the student. If the work is collaborative with others and/or part of a larger group project, the abstract should make clear what the student’s role was and should focus on that portion of the work.

## Participation

The SRC consists of three rounds:

1. **Paper Round:** Submissions are reviewed by a committee.
2. **Poster Round:** Accepted students present their posters to judges and attendees.
3. **Presentation Round:** Selected students from the poster round give a final talk to judges.

## Awards

Three winners from each category (undergraduate and graduate) will receive cash prizes ($500, $300, $200) and an award medal. The top students are invited to participate in the ACM Grand Finale.

## Submissions

Submit your work using the specified format:

- Use the `acmart` template: `\documentclass[sigconf,nonacm,screen,review]{acmart}`
- Limit to 2 pages, excluding references.
- Ensure anonymity in the PDF (double-blind submission).
