**Call for Papers**

PACT 2025 will be held in Irvine, California, USA, from November 3-6, 2025.

**Abstracts Due:** April 18, 2025  
**Papers Due:** April 25, 2025  
**Submission Site:** [https://pact25.hotcrp.com](https://pact25.hotcrp.com)


### **Scope**

The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. PACT brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications to present and discuss their latest research results, tools, and practical experiences.

PACT 2025 will be held as an in-person event in Irvine, California, USA. We encourage all authors of accepted papers to participate, and at least one author must attend the conference.

PACT seeks submissions in two categories:
- **Research Papers**
- **Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers**

### **Topics of Interest**
PACT welcomes submissions on topics including, but not limited to:
- Parallel architectures, including accelerators for AI and other domains
- Compilers and tools for parallel architectures
- Applications and experimental studies of parallel processing
- Computational models for concurrent execution
- Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures
- Compiler and hardware support for reducing memory latencies
- Support for correctness in hardware and software
- Reconfigurable parallel computing
- Dynamic translation and optimization
- I/O issues in parallel computing and their application impact
- Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications
- Middleware and runtime system support for parallel computing
- Application-specific parallel systems
- Distributed computing architectures and systems
- Heterogeneous systems leveraging various accelerators
- In-core and in-chip accelerators and their optimization
- Applications of machine learning to parallel computing
- Large-scale data processing, including in-memory computing accelerators
- Insights from modern parallel applications for architecture and compiler design

### **Research Papers**
Research papers will be evaluated by the PACT Program Committee based on:
- **Relevance:** The paper should align with PACT’s topics of interest.
- **Novelty/Originality:** The work should present new ideas or offer fresh perspectives.
- **Significance:** The research should address an important problem and have the potential to influence future work.
- **Results:** The claims should be well-supported by clear and validated results.
- **Comparison to Prior Work:** The paper should properly discuss existing literature, highlighting similarities, differences, and improvements.

### **Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers**
TPE papers focus on practical applications, industry challenges, and experience reports. A TPE paper must clearly explain its functionality, summarize practical experience with realistic case studies, and describe any supporting artifacts. The title of a TPE paper must include the prefix **"TPE:"**. TPE papers follow the same submission guidelines and are reviewed by the same Program Committee as research papers.

TPE papers will be evaluated based on:
- **Originality:** They should present PACT-related technologies applied to real-world problems.
- **Usability:** The tool or software should have broad applicability and aid PACT-related research.
- **Documentation:** The tool/software should be well-documented on a public website.
- **Benchmark Repository:** A benchmark suite should be provided for testing.
- **Availability:** Preference is given to tools/software that are freely available, though industry/commercial tools may be considered with justification.
- **Foundations:** The paper should relate to PACT’s principles, though extensive theoretical discussion is not required.

### **Submission Guidelines**
Submissions are due **April 18, 2025**, via the [conference submission site](https://pact25.hotcrp.com). Ensure that your submission meets the following requirements:
- **Format:** Papers are limited to **10 pages** (excluding references) in **ACM 8.5” x 11” format**, double-column, 9pt font (e.g., using the `sigconf` LaTeX template). The text box must not exceed **7.15” x 9”** (18.2cm x 22.9cm). Templates are available on the [ACM Author Gateway](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow).
- **Abstract:** Papers must include an abstract of **under 300 words**.
- **Originality:** Submissions must contain original material not previously published or under review elsewhere. Material presented at workshops without copyrighted proceedings may be submitted.
- **TPE Papers:** Must be prefixed with **"TPE:"** in the title.
- **Double-Blind Review:** The review process is **double-blind** to prevent bias. Submissions must not include author names, affiliations, or self-references that reveal authorship. Prior work by the authors must be cited in the third person.
- **Legibility:** Figures and graphs must be readable without magnification.
- **Submission Format:** Papers must be submitted in **PDF format**.
- **Supplementary Material:** A single **anonymized** PDF may be uploaded with additional proofs, results, or datasets. Reviewers are not required to consult supplementary material.

**Posters:**
- Poster submissions must follow the same formatting guidelines but are limited to **2 pages**.
- Papers not accepted for full presentation will automatically be considered for posters unless authors opt out in their abstract submission.
- Two-page poster summaries will be included in the conference proceedings.

### **Conflicts of Interest**
Authors must declare **all** conflicts of interest with PC members and external reviewers at submission time. Papers with undeclared or false conflicts may be rejected. Conflicts follow ACM’s [Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest).

### **Artifact Evaluation**
Authors of accepted papers are **encouraged** to submit their artifacts for evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation Committee assesses availability, functionality, and reproducibility. Successful artifacts will receive a **seal of approval** in the published paper. Authors can include a **2-page Artifact Appendix** in the final paper.

We encourage authors to use open-source frameworks such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [OCCAM](https://occam.cs.pitt.edu/), [reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/), and [Collective Knowledge](https://cknowledge.io/docs/) to improve artifact portability and reproducibility.
