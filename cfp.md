PACT 2025 will be held in **Irvine, California, USA**, 13-16 October, 2024.

**Submissions due: March 27, 2024**

> [!NOTE]
> **PACT 2025 includes a New Call for Tools and Practical Experience Papers**

## Scope

The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference sitting at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. The PACT conference series brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications, to present and discuss their latest research results.

PACT 2023 will be held as an in-person event in the beautiful city of Vienna. At least one of the authors of accepted papers will be required to attend the conference, and we encourage all the authors to participate.

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Parallel architectures
* Compilers and tools for parallel computer systems
* Applications and experimental systems studies of parallel processing
* Computational models for concurrent execution
* Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures
* Compiler and hardware support for hiding memory latencies
* Support for correctness in hardware and software
* Reconfigurable parallel computing
* Dynamic translation and optimization
* I/O issues in parallel computing and their relation to applications
* Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications
* Middleware and run time system support for parallel computing
* Application-specific parallel systems
* Distributed computing architectures and systems
* Heterogeneous systems using various types of accelerators
* In-core and in-chip accelerators and their exploitation
* Applications of machine learning to parallel computing
* Large scale data processing, including computing in memory accelerators
* Insights for the design of parallel architectures and compilers from modern parallel applications
* Neuromorphic computing both as an application for and a tool applied to architectures and compilers.


## Submitting your work

Paper submissions are due **April 1, 2023** by posting on the conference [submission site](https://pact23.hotcrp.com/). Please make sure that your paper satisfies all the following requirements before being submitted. Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines will be rejected by the submission system and/or subject to an administrative rejection.

* The paper must have an abstract under 300 words.
* The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. You may submit our own material that was (1) presented previously at a workshop without archived or copyrighted proceedings (including workshops where the authors chose not to have their work included in the proceedings) or (2) published to venues such as arXiv or IEEE CAL that have an explicit policy that do not preclude longer conference submissions.
* The submission is limited to ten (10) pages in the ACM 8.5" x 11" format (US letter size paper) using 9pt font, with no more than 7 lines per inch. This page limit applies to all content NOT INCLUDING references, and there is no page limit for references. Your paper must print satisfactorily on both Letter paper (8.5"x11") and A4 paper (8.27"x11.69"). The box containing the text should be no larger than 7.15"x9" (18.2cm x 22.9cm). Templates are available on the [ACM Author Gateway](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow).
* Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending someone else’s research. We realize that for some papers authorship will still be revealed, but as long as an effort was made to follow these guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Works that have been published before (see above) do not have to preserve author anonymity, but must declare the venue of the publication in the paper.
* Anonymized supplementary material may be provided in a single PDF file uploaded at paper submission time, containing material that supports the content of the paper, such as proofs, additional experimental results, data sets, etc. Reviewers are not required to read the supplementary material but may choose to do so.
* Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass.
* The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We suggest that you use only the four widely used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.

Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the poster session should indicate this in their abstract submission. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.

Please submit your work via the conference [submission site](https://pact23.hotcrp.com/).


## Conflicts of interest

Authors must identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external members of the community. We ask **all** authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts at the submission site. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or game the review system, the paper may be rejected. Conflicts of interests are defined according to ACM’s [conflict of interest policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest).


## Artifact evaluation

Authors of accepted PACT 2023 papers are encouraged to formally submit their supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess the availability, functionality, and reproducibility of the work and experimental results described in the paper. Submission is voluntary. We strongly encourage authors to consider submitting artifacts for their work, including simulators for new architectural designs and extensions.

We encourage authors to prepare their artifacts for submission and make them more portable, reusable and customizable using open-source frameworks including [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [OCCAM](https://occam.cs.pitt.edu/), [reprozip](https://www.reprozip.org/), [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) and [CK](https://cknowledge.io/docs/).

Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation process will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Authors of such papers will have an option to include their Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages). Authors are also encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available.


## Key dates

## Publication policies

PACT is supported by both ACM and IEEE and articles accepted for publication are available on both the ACM digital library and IEEE Xplore. By submitting your article to an PACT, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects), and the [IEEE Publication Policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/author-center/publishing-policies). Alleged violations of these policies will be investigated by officers of ACM or IEEE and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per their policies.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors [obtain an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs) from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
